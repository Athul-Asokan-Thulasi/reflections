When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
Git Remote (Git hub version of repository)
git remote add <remote_name> <url>
git remote -v  = output verbose data about remote (Urls to push and pull)
Needs to use when collaborating with other people or working from multiple devices(computers).
    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
